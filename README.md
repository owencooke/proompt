## Current Progress

Began implementing the Prompt Library page. Created the PromptCard component to display users' prompts.

Need to find a more efficient way to utilize icons and add them to the New, Open, and See More Details buttons for the prompts.

See the project's [Figma design file](https://www.figma.com/file/yAReOYpwFXfgAT1j23mwOr/proompt?type=design&node-id=3%3A6&mode=design&t=JxQhzeXlr1peugGr-1) for upcoming features.

> **Note**
> This project was designed using the **mobile-first** strategy. Figma designs are created for mobile platforms and eventually will be extended for desktop after initial implementation and testing feature functionality.
